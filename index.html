      The Galactic Sentinels, a crew consisting of robotic engineers, scientists, and space experts who were led by Captain Lyra Thorne also known as the 
      "Cosmic Wanderer", received a message from an unknown source. The messaged contained a hologram in which it showed the Planet Xyzel, a habitat 
      rich in biodiversity and is kept intact by the mystical Xyzel Leviathan or as the locals call it, the "Sky Weaver"  which is a colossal, 
      serpentine creature that has lurked through the planet's deepest waters for hundreds of years, its body shimmering with starlight. It's 
      bioluminescent scales and eyes gleam like that of distant galaxies up close. It's scales emit energy that stabilizes the planet's core, the 
      Sky Weaver also protects the planets from threats by creating a force field as danger approaches it. The message started talking, in a warning 
      manner, that the Sky Weaver's presence has not been felt for a few days already as the planet has started to experience occasional earthquakes 
      and the life on it has started to lose it's touch. The Xyleans asked the Sentinels to help in finding the whereabouts of their beloved Sky Weaver.
      Captain Lyra told her crew to prepare as they embarked on a journey towards Xyzel, she wanted to find the beast as quick as possible. Soon, they
      arrived and wasted no time going into the Abyss of Cosmos, the underwater habitat of the Sky Weaver. A scientist and engineer accompanied the Captain
      as she went down into the deep water while the rest helped to keep the people calm. As they examined deeper into the abyss, they came across a massive 
      cave which emitted a faint light from inside. Captain Lyra and the scientists ventured into the cave, then suddenly what they see baffles them. There, 
      on the cave floor, lay the scales of the Sky Weaver and what was that other thing...blood. Traces of blood found on the floor, they suspected it came 
      from the beast and this worried them. But, amidst their fear, they find more scales leading deeper into the cave, they followed the glow and found 
      themselves in a cave threshold in which the other side was that of a reef-like environment with canyons all over. In the distance they spot a glowing 
      figure and realized it was the Sky Weaver, but wait, something was wrong, it was bound with chains and inside mechanical cage that had locks which 
      needed a passcode. The creature's body looked frail and weak, it had a few wounds from what looked like hooks. They approaced it slowly and it looked 
      at them as if asking for help, in a rush, they went to the lock and examined it. It had the name HYDEN CORPS, which was a group that targeted the main
      power sources of a planet. Turns out, they needed to find the missing number for a 5-number passcode to unlock it. Captain Lyra, the scientist and the 
      engineer all made attempts to crack the code, but with each time they failed to find it, the passcode would reset and give them a new set of 4 numbers, 3 different numbers 
      below it and the time they had to complete that specific passcode or else the chains of the lock would release a shock which would electrify the leviathan. 
      All of them were in visible panic as they didn't want to further harm it. Then they found 2 clues near engraved on the lock which said "The greatest 
      always knows" and "The first of 26 is what you need" which made them wonder what it meant. Again, they tried but failed.The engineer, Sir Harris 
      Woodlocke, suggested they choose the greatest out of the 3 numbers below the given passcode, all agreed but the scientist stepped up and said they 
      should analyze the second clue as well so to not risk injuring the Sky Weaver further. The poor beast looked exhausted, and the Sentinels were battling 
      with time. Then, Filmon, the scientist, had an idea that the second one meant the alphabet since it said 26.

      They tried the code once more and this time applied what they discussed, there was a brief moment of silence, then there was a whoosh sound, it
      came from the lock. It was opening and after a while, it released the Sky Weaver from the cage and it swiftly swam back towards the cave. Captain 
      Lyra, Sir Harris, and Monsieur Filmon felt quite relieved by this and swam back to the surface of the Abyss. They came back and relayed this 
      information to the Xyleans, the people greatly thanked the Sentinels for bringing back their Sky Weaver to them. With that, the Galactic Sentinels 
      bid their farewell to the Planet of Xyzel and rode off into the galaxy, awaiting their next adventure.
